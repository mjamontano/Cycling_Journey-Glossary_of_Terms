  <tr><td><b>G.C.</b></td><td>abbreviation for General Classification; the timing splits used to determine who is winning in a stage race; calculated from the first rider over the line each day time is then measured back by gaps from the winner of the day; time gaps are then calculated back between riders and added to the overall position of riders relative to each other; riders can attack in stage races for time rather than winning the days stage; in such circumstances alliances can form where some riders in a breakaway will work to help others win the days stage despite not contesting the finish as the overall gap the breakaway gains helps them on G.C.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><b>gap</b></td><td>a distance between two or more riders large enough for drafting to no longer be effective; without a gap, the others can draft along using significantly less power to sustain the same speed as the rider in front; while gaps are usually achieved through attacks, on mountain climbs, where slower speeds means the advantage of drafting is much less significant, riders are often gapped who simply cannot maintain the tempo of the faster riders; can also refer to the space in between a jump and the landing, which is common in mountain biking</td></tr>
