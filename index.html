  <tr><td><b>tubulars</b></td><td>also known as sew-ups, lightweight road tires and rims with the tread directly on the tube, which is glued right onto a rim without bead hooks; do have tubes inside, but because the tube is totally "sewn up" it is not visible without disassembly of the tire; most popular for racing as the construction can be used to make a very light tire; they require glue to change and for this reason have become primarily obsolete to the "clincher tire" for convenience; opposite of clincher tires, which require a rim with a bead hook and typically use a separate inner tube inside</td></tr>
